Welcome to Hangman!

This is a game that can be played entirely within the terminal!

There are 3 levels:
1. Easy       ->   Play without losing lives
2. Standard   ->   Start with 10 lives
3. Hard       ->   Start with 6 lives

As you play through the levels there is constant user feedback telling the player whether their guess is correct or incorrect.
On standard and hard levels, there is also a hangman image which appears on incorrect guesses.
